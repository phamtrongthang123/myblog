My name is Trong-Thang Pham. I'm a student of University of Science, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 

# About this blog

I am having struggled with my forgetting knowledge easily. I don’t know why but a lot of times I forget what I have learned even it was only a week before. Currently, I’m using paper and pen for noting stuff. It’s good enough for the short term, but I lose my notes all the time. Therefore I need a more persistent method like writing a blog.

My goal when writing a post will be easy to read, and the more example the better. I plan to write in Vietnamese when I am lazy, so there will be 2 languages. I also have tags on them, VI for Vietnamese and EN for English.
