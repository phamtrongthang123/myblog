# Why I write this blog

I'm one of those people who cannot remember for too long. Thanks to that I have to write down everything. This website is somewhere I post random stuff that I would write as my note. 

My goal when writing a post will be easy to read, and the more example the better. I plan to write in Vietnamese when I am lazy, so there will be 2 languages. I also have tags on them, VI for Vietnamese and EN for English. 

# Research interest

Anything relate to space and representation. Theory or practical is all good.

# Why this research interest

This interest did not come to me as something I like, but as something that I know I need. Well, it can be considered the same but let's hear me out. What I mean is I picked it because during my journey through many fields and majors, I found that there is something I want to know real bad. I was not able to form it into words, not until I finished my thesis and graduated. After graduating, I looked back at all my works in the past, analyzed them, and found that I always try to think in a way that merges many concepts into something more abstract, then look at their interaction. At first, I think my direction is super generic, I mean who doesn't want to understand what are they doing right? Especially in the Deep Learning field right now, there are tasks called representation learning too, and also explainable AI. So I did not take it seriously at the beginning, and I tried to explore some more specific cases, hopefully, I could find the particular small thing that trigger my interest, not the whole big field right now. So far I have made no progress, unluckily. 

The homepage I did not include much about what my interest is about. Please wait I will add them later, I promise.
