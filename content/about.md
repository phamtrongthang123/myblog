## Why I write this blog

I'm one of those people who cannot remember for too long. Thanks to that I have to learn to write every moment I can. This website is actually somewhere I post random stuff that I write as my note. 

My goal when writing a post will be easy to read, and the more example the better. I plan to write in Vietnamese when I am lazy, so there will be 2 languages. I also have tags on them, VI for Vietnamese and EN for English. 

# Why this research interest

This interest did not come to me as something I like, but as something I know I need it. Well it can be considered the same but let's hear me out. What I mean is not that I pick it because I like it, I pick it because during my journey through many fields and majors (math, ML, DL, bayes field, pure programming, design, social, etc.), and yeah I did study them seriously, I found that there is something I want to know real bad. I was not able to form it into words, not until I finished my thesis and graduated. After graduating, I look back at all my works in the past, analyze them and found that I always trying to think in a way that merge many concept into something more abstract, then see them as some kind of item floating before my eyes, with their relationship exposed. At first, I think my direction is super generic, I mean who don't want to understand what they doing right?, especially in DL field right now, there are task call representation learning too, and also explainable AI. That's why I did not take it seriously at the beginning, and I tried to explore some more specific case, hopefully I could find some small thing that really trigger my interest, not whole big field right now. So far I made no progress, and I think I am in deep rabit hole right now. It just so interesting. For some freaking reason, when I was studying at school and university, I could not wrap my head around abstract math, me right now looking at new point of view, I just can't help myself from eating them.  

The homepage I did not include much about what my interest is about. Please wait I will add them later, I promise.
