# About this blog

Having struggled about my forgetting knowledges easily. I don't know why but a lot of times I forget what I have learnt even it was like a weak before. Currently I'm using paper and pen to note. It's good enough for a short term but I lose my notes all the time. Therefore I need more persistent method like writing blog. 

My goal when writing a post will be easy to read and the more example the better.
