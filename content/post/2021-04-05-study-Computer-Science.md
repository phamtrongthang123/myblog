Many study CS to find jobs, I study CompSci because:

- I want to know what fun about this field
- I want to write my own:
  - Android App
  - Cross platform app
  - Website
  - Game
  - Programming Language
- I want to crack some program, hack some web. Legally of course.
- I want to participate in some competitions.
- I want to try to follow the trend of this field, like doing Machine Learning / Deep Learning, the bitcoin / blockchain things. Thinking back i haven't try building any blockchain related stuff.

If you ask me if I'm jealous other people who make good money when they followed only 1 path, I would say yes. I mean I do want money. But if you ask me to go back and redo everything, I definitely say no. Those stuff I did, and experience, is precious to me. To me, they are like my friends.

Doing new stuff is like meeting new friends, keep doing them is like travelling with friends, parting them is like not meeting and talking to my friends. It is unreplaceable. So yeah, I do jealous, but I'm not regretting anything, so no go back. 

This year Nov, I will be graduated from CS. So looking back now, they are all fun memory to do difference stuff. I even got some prize home, you know! But like I said, I will be very sad. I have to find a job, stick with it. Wait, now that I think about it, isn't it like marriage. I mean I have to stick with 1 friend for the rest of my life... Marry a friend huh? Wait those are very weird thoughts right now.
