Hi, I am Trong-Thang Pham. I finished my Bachelor in Computer Science at the University of Science at the end of 2021. I currently working as AI Researcher to improve and work my way through to get into a PhD program. I would love to work in research in theory about spaces, abstraction, representation, and their relationship. But in my company, I currently work on graphics, e.g. photorealistic 2d and 3d reconstruction. I write this blog to share what I think during my study in those fields.

# Research interest

Anything relates to space and representation. Theory or practice is all good.
