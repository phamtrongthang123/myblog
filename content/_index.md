# Why I write this blog

I'm one of those people who cannot remember for too long. Thanks to that I have to learn to write every moment I can. This website is actually somewhere I post random stuff that I write as my note. 

My goal when writing a post will be easy to read, and the more example the better. I plan to write in Vietnamese when I am lazy, so there will be 2 languages. I also have tags on them, VI for Vietnamese and EN for English. 

# Reseearch interest

Anything relate to space and representation. Theory or practical is all good.
