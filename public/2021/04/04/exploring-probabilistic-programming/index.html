<p>I asked a person who has higher experience than me to explore with me, just help me not being lonely.</p>
<p>The framework existed at that moment sucks, not stable, documents was lacking, hard to install or develop, pymc3 use Theano, pymc4 authors adviced to not use it, pyro was lacking documents.</p>
<p>I mainly looking into engineer stuff like how to use, what&rsquo;s in the framework. And later I looked up to Causal Inference, where I try to write a document about a paper called CEVAE apply VAE to sold the Causal Inference problem.</p>
<p>To be honest I am not really understand what is pyro capable of.</p>
<p>Happy when Judea Pearl like my comment on his tweet, my tutorial got accept into Pyro main page.</p>
<p>Judea tweeted about somebody don&rsquo;t understand why we have to name so many simple stuff. I comment that it is the same as when we are coding, we want to wrap as much as possible to increase the abstraction level.</p>
<p>My tutorial wrote about how to implement MLE and MAP in pyro, pretty simple but no one has written about it yet.</p>
<p>Why am i writing those stuff anyway.</p>
