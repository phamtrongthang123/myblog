<p>Bắt đầu ôn bài thôi nhỉ. Từ đây sẽ là chuỗi bài ôn bài HDH cuối kì cho mình.
Mình sẽ đi theo hướng giải bt vì nếu tóm tắt sẽ không đủ thời gian để hoàn thành. :(</p>
<h3 id="81-name-two-differences-between-logical-and-physical-addresses">8.1 Name two differences between logical and physical addresses</h3>
<ul>
<li>user sẽ thấy theo logical  - còn thực tế sử dụng physical</li>
<li>logial từ 0 -&gt; max - physical được map qua R+0 -&gt; R+max</li>
<li>logical được CPU sinh ra - physical thì memory unit đọc được</li>

The CPU knows whether it wants an instruction (instruction fetch) or data (data fetch or store). Therefore, two base-limit register pairs are provided: one for instructions and one for data. The instruction base–limit register pair is automatically read-only, so programs can be shared among different users. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme.</h3>
<h3 id="83-why-are-page-sizes-always-powers-of-2">8.3 Why are page sizes always powers of 2?</h3>
<p>t chỉ tìm ra lý do nằm ở việc tính dễ hơn thôi, không biết sách có đề cập gì thêm không.</p>

Explain how this effect could be used to decrease the amount of time needed to copy a large amount of memory from one place to another. What effect would updating some byte on the one page have on the other page?</h3>
<p>Nghe như là kiểu map vào 1 chỗ, nếu thế thì khi copy sẽ chỉ copy 1 lần, thay vì copy 2 lần.
Còn nếu update thì sẽ xảy ra vụ thay đổi. Ê nghe giống con trỏ hay reference ở cpp nhỉ.</p>

A key is a 4-bit quantity. Each 2-K block of memory has a key (the storage key) associated with it. The CPU also has a key (the protection key) associated with it.

The central processor has a cycle time of 1 microsecond. It costs an additional 1 microsecond to access a page other than the current one. Pages have 1,000 words, and the paging device is a drum that rotates at 3,000 revolutions per minute and transfers 1 million words per second. The following statistical measurements were obtained from the system:</h3>
<ul>
<li>One percent of all instructions executed accessed a page other than
the current page.</li>

a page already in memory.</li>

A small process that manipulates the matrix resides in page 0 (locations 0 to 199). Thus, every instruction fetch will be from page 0.
